A demo repo to show one way to manage dependencies with Composer and deploy to WP Engine.

Tutorial: [Coming Soon](#)

The root of this repo represents the `wp-content/` directory of your WordPress install. Right now, all plugins are managed with Composer. This does not _always_ have to be the case, and you could exclude a custom plugin or two in the `.gitignore`.
