The root of this repo represents the `wp-content/` directory of your WordPress install. Right now, all plugins are managed with Composer. This does not _always_ have to be the case, and you could exclude a custom plugin or two in the `.gitignore`.

## Why Qorp?

I tried to think of a short subdomain that was not taken on WP Engine's hosting. I wanted the site to emulate a 21st century take on [Acme Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation). So, I thought corporation, or abbreviated to corp., which then led me to Qorp.
